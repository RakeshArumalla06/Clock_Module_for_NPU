# NPU Clock Module – C2S/MeitY RISC-V Edge-AI Processor

This repository contains the design work completed as part of the Special Manpower Development Programme for Chips to System Design (SMDP-C2SD) funded by the Ministry of Electronics & IT (MeitY), Govt. of India.

The broader project aims to build an Ultra-Low-Power SHAKTI RISC-V Based Lightweight Edge-AI Processor for IoT-enabled healthcare applications.
The SoC includes two major subsystems:

CPU Complex (RISC-V)

NPU Accelerator (custom lightweight AI engine)

Our team at IIIT Tiruchirappalli is responsible for designing the NPU subsystem, specifically the Clock Module.
